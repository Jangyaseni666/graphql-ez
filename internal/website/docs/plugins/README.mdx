## GraphQL EZ Plugins

`GraphQL EZ` supports development and web-server level plugins through its platform.
You can check all the public available plugins in the <Link color="blue.500" href="/plugins">Plugin Hub</Link>.

All these plugins can be specified in your configuration in the `ez.plugins` property:

By convention, all the EZ Plugins start with `ez` followed by the capitalized name.

```ts
CreateApp({
  //...
  ez: {
    plugins: [
      ezPlugin(),
      // ...
    ],
  },
});
```

Check <Link color="blue.500" href="/docs/plugins/how-ez-plugins-work">How EZ Plugins work?</Link> for information about how they work and how you can create your plugins and contribute on the ecosystem.

## Envelop Plugins

`GraphQL EZ` is based on [**Envelop**](https://www.envelop.dev/), and therefore, all its functionality is available here.

To specify your **Envelop Plugins**, use the property `envelop.plugins` in your configuration.

```ts
CreateApp({
  //...
  envelop: {
    plugins: [
      usePlugin(),
      // ...
    ],
  },
});
```

Check [Envelop Plugin Hub](https://www.envelop.dev/plugins) for more information.

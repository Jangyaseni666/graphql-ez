# GraphQL EZ

`GraphQL EZ` is a Plugin-Based `GraphQL API Server` designed to be **Easy** and **Powerful**,
with big customization in mind.

This library is based on [**Envelop**](https://www.envelop.dev/),
which is a very powerful Plugin-Based `GraphQL Execution orchestrator` that allows developers to build,
share and collaborate on GraphQL-related plugins while filling the missing pieces in GraphQL implementations.
You can read more about it [**here**](https://www.envelop.dev/docs).

With integrations for [**Fastify**](https://www.fastify.io/), [**Express**](https://expressjs.com/),
[**Hapi**](https://hapi.dev/), [**Koa Website**](https://koajs.com/), [**Next.js API Routes**](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) and
[**Node.js HTTP**](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html):
